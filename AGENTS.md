# AGENTS.md — tcb-wepro

This is an **operonx** project (made with operonx 1.18.1). The logic is
Python functions (ops), wired into graphs, which an application runs as
services and jobs.

## Before you write code

1. Read `.operonx/guide/README.md`. It indexes the guide of every installed
   operonx package (core, and operonx-agents or operonx-kb when added), and
   every example in them is tested against the installed version.
2. Before you use an operonx API, re-read the guide page that covers it.
   Do not write an operonx API from memory.
3. Read `app/main.py`. It is the map of the product.

## The ladder

- **op**: `@op` in `ops.py`. One step of logic; it returns a dict literal.
- **graph**: `@graph` in `graph.py`. Wires ops with `>>`. Its parameters
  are what it is given (a request body, a job item); the outputs of the
  ops wired to `END` are the answer.
- **Job**: runs a graph once per item of its `items` (a list, a function
  that yields them, or a `.jsonl` file) and keeps every result in its
  record. `reduce=` runs one graph over all the results; `steps=[...]`
  runs jobs in order as one command; `schedule=schedule(at="07:00")` also
  runs it on a clock inside `operonx serve`.
- **Service**: a graph behind `http(...)`, `webhook(...)`, `schedule(...)`
  or `websocket(...)`.
- **Application**: `APP` in `app/main.py`. Declare every service and job
  there.
- **operonx.toml**: only points the CLIs at `APP`, plus `[tracing]`. Never
  put `[[serve]]` blocks in it (deprecated; removed in operonx 2.0).

## Serving a graph

- The graph's signature is the request: the JSON body and the query string
  fill its parameters by name, and a parameter's default is used when the
  caller leaves it out. A field the graph does not take, a required
  parameter nobody sent, or a name in both query and body is answered `400`
  before any run. Never write an op that unpacks a request dict.
- The reply is the outputs of the ops wired to `END`, as one JSON object.
  For a flat body, have the last op return those fields at its top level.
- Check what a caller sent (an unknown id, a value out of range) in the
  graph's first op; a raise there answers `500` with the run's trace id.
- A body shaped by someone else (a mail server's webhook) goes whole to one
  parameter: `Service(..., input="payload")`.
- `ingress()` / `egress()` (doors) are only for a run that handles many
  items: a websocket call, a stream of events. Never add them to a
  request–reply graph.
- Each tick of work over many items is a `Job` with `schedule=`, not a
  loop inside one op.

## Never define a `@graph` inside a function

Every `@graph` is defined at module level in `graph.py`. No factory that
builds a graph in a nested `def` and returns it:

```python
# no
def build_answer_flow(answer, k=8):
    @graph
    def answer_flow(): ...

    return answer_flow


# yes
@graph
def answer_flow(question, k):  # a setting is a graph input
    ...
```

- A setting (`k`, a model name, a threshold) is a graph input or an op
  setting, never a closure variable.
- A different shape is a different module-level graph (`dense_search`,
  `hybrid_search`), or one graph with an `if_` branch. Pick which one to
  run in `app/main.py`, not by generating graphs.
- Keep the edges: `START >> a >> b >> END` is written out, always.

## Layout

- One feature is one folder: `src/<feature>/graph.py` (wiring only: no
  logic, no I/O, no Python `if`) and `src/<feature>/ops.py` (the logic).
  Private helpers go in `src/<feature>/_<name>.py`.
- Imports go one way: `app/` → `graph.py` → `ops.py` → helpers. Nothing in
  `src/` imports `app/`, and no feature imports another feature's graph.
- Reach models and stores by their key in `resources.yaml`
  (`LLMOp.of(resource="assistant")`). Never build a client in code.
- Secrets live only in `.env`, as `${VAR}` in `resources.yaml`. Add every
  new name to `.env.example`. Never commit `.env`.
- Tests go in `tests/`. Call an op directly (`my_op(x=1)()`), run a graph
  with `Operon` or a `Job`, and never call a real model: use a fake one.

## Commands

```bash
uv run pytest                 # the tests: keep them green
uv run operonx serve --list   # every service, and where it listens
uv run operonx run --list     # every job
uv run operonx serve          # serve every service (and run scheduled jobs on their clocks)
uv run operonx run NAME       # run one job
```

## Rules

- Never `print()`. Log with `from operonx.core.loggings import LOGGER`.
- Let names come from variables: `reply = chat(text=text)` is named `reply`.
  Write `name=` only when other code reads that name (a trace filter, a
  state key, an eval), and build one op per line (`a, b = f(), g()` names
  neither).
- Branch with `if_(cond, a).else_(b)` inside the `>>` chain. Never build a
  `BranchOp` or `Branch` yourself.
- An op that raises does not raise: the run's result has `"$errors"`.
  Check for it.
- To upgrade operonx: `uv lock --upgrade-package operonx && uv sync`, then `uv run operonx guide`, then
  re-read `.operonx/guide/README.md`. After adding an operonx package
  (`uv add operonx-agents`), run `uv run operonx guide`.

## operonx guides

<!-- operonx:guide -->
Installed: operonx 1.19.3. Read `.operonx/guide/README.md` first: it lists every
page of every installed operonx package, each tested against that version.
Upgrade: `uv lock --upgrade-package operonx && uv sync`, then `uv run operonx guide`
(after `uv add operonx-agents` or `operonx-kb`, just `uv run operonx guide`).
Names come from variables: write `name=` only when other code reads the name,
one op per line. Branch with `if_(cond, a).else_(b)` in the `>>` chain, never a
hand-built `BranchOp`.
