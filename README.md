# tcb-wepro

A chat service: one LLMOp on the llm:assistant model. Built on [operonx](https://pypi.org/project/operonx/).

`src/chat/` is the feature: `ops.py` holds the logic, `graph.py` wires it
around an `LLMOp` that calls the `llm:assistant` model from
`resources.yaml`. `app/main.py` declares the `chat` service that runs it.

## Run

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest          # offline: the tests answer with a local fake model
cp .env.example .env   # then set LLM_API_KEY (and LLM_BASE_URL / LLM_MODEL if not OpenAI)
```

## Serve

```bash
uv run operonx serve --list   # what would listen, and where
uv run operonx serve          # POST /chat on :8000 (PORT overrides)
curl -s localhost:8000/chat -d '{"question": "What is a workflow engine?"}'
```

## Grow it

A new feature is a new folder under `src/` with its own `graph.py` and
`ops.py`, and one more `Service` (or `Job`) in `app/main.py`. A new model is
one more `llm:` key in `resources.yaml`, its secret in `.env`. Read
`AGENTS.md` and `.operonx/guide/README.md` first.
